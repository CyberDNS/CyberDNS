Iâ€™m a software architect and developer, specializing in **C#** and **.NET**, with a focus on creating scalable and efficient solutions. My work often involves **automation**, **IoT**, and **cloud technologies**, where I explore the latest advancements in **C#** and **.NET**.

## Highlighted Projects

- **Lupusec2Mqtt**: Enables the Lupusec XT2 alarm system to communicate with MQTT brokers, enhancing its compatibility with Home Assistant and other smart home platforms. It supports various functionalities, including alarm panel control, sensor states, and power switch operations.
